 * Decoder for the trainer ports or hacked receivers for both
 * Futaba and JR formats.  The ppm_valid flag is set whenever
 * a valid frame is received.
 *
 * Pulse widths are stored as unscaled 16-bit values in ppm_pulses[].
 * If you require actual microsecond values, divide by CLOCK.
 * For an 8 Mhz clock and typical servo values, these will range
 * from 0x1F00 to 0x4000.
 *
 * Copied from autopilot (autopilot.sf.net) thanx alot Trammell
